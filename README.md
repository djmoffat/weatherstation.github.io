# weatherstation.github.io

This code is a hobby project, for my pi, to allow the collection of weather data in the area, and plot it.

Currently using the
* DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
* A cheap LDR

In the future I may include
* Comparison of weather to predicted weather
* Some basic prediction as to what the weather may do
* A rain detector
* A buzzer to sound when it is about to start raining
* A second DHT, for both inside and outside
* A second LDR for location monitoring
* Soil sensor for moisture detection
* Water pump activation - for automatic plant watering
